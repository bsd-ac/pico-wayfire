# pico de

shabby collection of dotfiles and scripts put together to get a so-called DE using [wayfire](https://wayfire.org)

## Overview

These are a personal jumble of utilities, so use with care.

Using this can pour wine on your sofa, let your cat out on of the house at night or give you a cool looking desktop.<br/>
Chances of the latter are marginally higher.

## Dependencies

This collection is made and used on Gentoo linux.<br/>
Care has been taken to ensure that all dependencies are satisifiable using some package in Gentoo, so it should be very easy to maintain; upgrades can be managed just like any other software.

The list of dependencies can be found by looking at the latest package ebuild - [pico-de-9999.ebuild](https://github.com/bsd-ac/wayland-desktop/blob/master/gui-apps/pico-de/pico-de-9999.ebuild) - most of the dependencies are available in that overlay or in the main ::gentoo tree.<br/>
It contains all the needed fonts, icons, gtk themes, applications, etc. that are used and configured here.

## Design goal

The aim is to create a minimalistic desktop environment, that can be used by most people, without shoving opinions (as much as possible).<br/>
(Unless it's my opinion, in which case, deal with it, or politely ask for a change, I'm not that bad in small doses)

Good
- GTK theming
- QT theming
- Icon theming
- Fonts
- Cursors

Bad
- Editors - emacs vs vim - gtfo
- Browsers - Firefox vs Chrome vs Chromium - gtfo
- Shell - zsh vs bash vs mksh vs fish vs whatever - gtfo double fast

Ambivalent
- Terminals - currently supporting terminator - *meh* about adding more

Anything else can be asked for and discussed in issues.
